# Quants Quest

__Quants Quest__ is a web application designed for learners of Econometrics at  beginner level. It tests the knowledge of users for the basic but most crucial concepts in Econometrics. 

The application targets undergraduate students who are about to start the final year of their degree, although the usage is open to anybody who might be interested with quantitative analysis. 

The designer's aim is to test the user's knowledge on the basic concepts of Econometrics and teach them correct applications through an online interactive quiz. This is to ensure that users understand the basics before moving on to more advanced topics.

## Credits

- _Quants Quest_ was suggested by  Microsoft Co-Pilot as the web platform name. 
- The idea of using "querySelectorAll" method and ".checked" property in the checkAnswer() function code is taken from an example provided in the following page: https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-radio-button/
- The idea of getting dynamic values (such as question number, latest score, etc) from the webpage elements rather than using global variables in the javascript file is from Code Institute's love-maths walkthrough example.
